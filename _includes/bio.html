		    I have 17+ years of experience as a software engineer, entrepreneur, and team builder.
		    I founded and sold two
		    startups (BillMonk, Precision Polling), and built a new 8-figure ARR business at SurveyMonkey (Audience).

		    I'm a hands-on technical leader who has built
		    software products from the ground up, run large
		    engineering teams, and provided
		    guidance at the executive and board level.  I'm
		    motivated by product success and business growth,
		    not technology for technology's sake.

		    <!-- I have a computer

		    I recently moved from Seattle to New York City.
        While I'm not seeking employment opportunities at this time,
        I'm interested in becoming more involved in the NYC tech scene.
