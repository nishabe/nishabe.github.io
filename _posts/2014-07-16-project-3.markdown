description: Built a self-service website for creating and running automated phone surveys (e.g. "Press 1 if you commute by bike..."). The cost is only 10 cents per call, with no setup fees. This made it the fastest, easiest, and cheapest way for politicians, non-profits, and companies to collect data. We offered advanced analytics, including weighting and cross-tabs. This company was acquired by SurveyMonkey.
